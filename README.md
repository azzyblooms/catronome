<h1>CATRONOME!!!!!!</h1>
it's a metronome...... with silly cats!
to be more specific, it shows a random cat image whenever the metronome reaches a strong beat.
you can also customize the metronome with 5 different sounds, 5 different time signatures, and a volume slider! (note that the volume only affects the strong beat)
the metronome supports tempos between 30BPM and 400BPM (but be realistic, when are you gonna need something slower/faster than that?)
that's all there is to it, really. have fun!
